Why can't I purchase this item?
We want to ensure that limited items (particularly desirable items that are only available in small quantities, for example) are available for our customers to order. For this reason, these items are protected by various technical security measures against being ordered, for example, by automated systems or commercially acting persons.

Invitations are typically valid for 2 hours from the time you have received them in your inbox. The validity of the invitation is clearly stated in the email with your invitation.

Why haven't I received an invitation yet?
Invites are typically limited as these items are in high demand. Once you've signed up for an invitation, you'll be in the running to get an invite for the next 7 days after the product's official release date. Invites are only sent out after the release date has been reached. If you don't get an invitation by then or the following next 7 days, we're sorry but you'll have to sign up for an invitation again when the item is back in stock.

How do I know if an item is invite-only?

Can I return invite-only items?
Yes, you can return invite-only items.

Unfortunately, you cannot change the colour and size you picked after you have signed up for an invitation.

Why is my preferred payment method not available?,Order related queries,"We're sorry if your favourite payment method isn't available for your order.

With some payment methods, especially with invoice payments, we take the financial risk to provide you with a try before you buy service. This is why we risk check each transaction to ensure security for you and for us.

Some situations can influence the payment methods availability. For instance, if delivery address and billing address do not match because of typos, changes of address, family name or if you chose a Pick up Point for your delivery. Another reason might be if you still have some open invoices with us. Even If you've already transferred the money or made a return, it is possible that we haven't processed it yet.

However, please understand that we also consider that some payment methods may involve higher costs or risks. Like other platforms and shops, we use independent credit bureaus in order to have secure transactions and we reserve the right to decline a payment method for some orders (you can find more details in our Terms & Conditions).

Our Customer Care team has no way of changing the payment methods offered to you at checkout and we are unable to find out exactly why a payment method is not being offered.

If your favourite payment method is unavailable, we're sorry in advance. You will still be able to use all of our other services and can select one of the other options, which are all free.",Payments

How to do online card payment with 3D Secure ?,Order related queries,"European regulations are changing to make online card payment more secure for you. For orders placed after January 1st 2021, you may be asked to authenticate your payment through a 3D secure process. This will be branded according to the type of card you're paying with, for example, Visa Secure, Mastercard Identity Check or American Express SafeKey.

What do I need to do?
If you haven't already, you will need to register your payment card for 3D Secure. Most banks usually provide a way to enrol your card online, so check the website of your bank for more information.If you have previously registered for 3D Secure, or have used this feature before, you will not need to register again. However, your bank may have defined an entirely new process to improve your payment experience. Some banks have designed a new smartphone application specifically for this purpose. Please get in touch with your bank for more information.To make sure you can pay for your next order easily and securely, we recommend that you activate 3D Secure before you place your next online order.

What will change?
You may have been asked to authenticate with 3D Secure when paying online before, however with the new regulation comes a new process, offering better security and easier ways to authenticate.The video below shows an example of how the new process could look. In this case, the bank uses the customer's smartphone and fingerprint to prove the customer's identity.",Payments

Report content on Zalando,Non order related queries,"What is reporting?
Reporting allows you to flag content related to any items and reviews on the Zalando app or website, based on concerns that it might not be in line with applicable laws or our policies.

While we have rigorous checks in place to make sure everything on Zalando is compliant, if you’re concerned about something you found, let us know and we’ll have a look.

What can I report and how?
You can report any item on Zalando, or anything about its details or how it’s shown. You can also report all reviews on Zalando. Look out for the ‘Report’ link marked with a flag icon present on every item details page or for the ‘Report’ button next to the review.

This reporting mechanism is not for content outside of the Zalando website or app — like emails, social media posts, ads or anything else.

What are the reasons for reporting?
You can report items or their related content, or reviews, on legal grounds — if you think they might violate any applicable laws or Zalando policies.

To make it easier to know what counts as legal grounds when reporting items, we’ve created the following categories:

	* Intellectual property and copyrights
	* Wrong or missing information
	* Product safety concerns
	* Environmental concerns
	* Inappropriate content

If you have a legal ground for reporting that’s not covered here, you can tell us about it by entering additional information in the reporting form.

Similarly, we’ve created the following categories when reporting reviews:

	* Intellectual property and copyrights
	* Inappropriate content

Can I report things for other reasons?
Reporting is a way for you to share your concerns about items or their related content or about reviews based on legal grounds. For any other reasons, like issues with your orders and deliveries, please contact our [customer care team](https://www.zalando.co.uk/faq/).

What happens after I report something?
The item or its content, or the review that you report, along with your concerns, will be sent to the relevant team for review. They’ll assess it against applicable laws and Zalando policies to make sure that it’s compliant. If not, they’ll decide what actions to take, like removing the item or its content, or removing the review from Zalando.

Through the process, we’ll share email updates on our decisions and actions, so keep an eye on your inbox.

What if I don’t agree with your decision?
In the email that you get about our decision, you’ll also find a link to contest the decision if you disagree with it. You can do this any time within 6 months of receiving it. In that process, you’ll also be able to give us any additional information that could help us rethink our decision.

Of course, you’ll also have the option to approach any out-of-court settlement body to challenge our decision, or appeal against it in the relevant courts.

What are trusted flaggers?
Trusted flaggers are individuals or organisations who have been recognised as such by the relevant authorities, as defined in Article 22 of the EU Digital Services Act. If you are a trusted flagger, please make sure that the email address you enter in the reporting form is the same as the one you registered with the authorities.

Please never visit any links or open any attached files in any emails that look suspicious.

Things to look out for:
Spelling errors or grammar inconsistencies: these emails are typically auto-generated or poorly translated.

The sender's address. It should match the domain of the company or entity they claim to represent.

How they address you: For instance, at Zalando, we always use your name (e.g ‘Hello Juan'). If it simply says ""Dear user/client,"" be suspicious!

Your data report will contain an overview of your account and log-in information, order overview, personalisation preferences, and liked items. It also includes information about data retention periods and third-party sharing.

What if my data file failed to download?
If you requested your file and it fails to download, it could be because the link has expired. The download link is only valid for 30 days after it is received. After this, you will need to submit a new request.

If your download link is valid but failed to download, it could be due to a network issue, a problem with your browser, or an issue on the server side.

How can I better protect my account?,Non order related queries,"The easiest way to protect your account is by choosing a strong password. Here are a few recommendations:

* Make it long. Using long passwords is critical to password strength. An 8-character password will take anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks to crack while a 16-character password will take a minimum of 34.000 years to crack.

* Use lower and upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. The password that strong would take 2 minutes to crack while it would take 3 weeks for attackers to crack the password H0wStr0!g

* Do not reuse passwords. Reusing the same password for multiple accounts is dangerous as it makes you vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks, which take leaked credentials from one site/service and use them on other sites/services. It's as if you had multiple houses and used the same lock and key for all of them.

* Make your passwords random . Do not include words related to your personal information in your passwords as it would give an advantage to attackers.

* Use a password manager. A password manager is an application that helps you create, store, and manage unique passwords. It is the easiest and most secure way to accomplish this.

How does the Fashion Assistant work,Non order related queries,"What can the Fashion Assistant help me with?

How does the Fashion Assistant work?
You can open the Fashion Assistant from the homepage, the catalogue, or the product detail page by clicking the Fashion Assistant icon. The assistant is integrated with a publicly available interface from the company OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT).

After this you can always start a new chat by clicking on the Fashion Assistant icon again.

Can I also talk to a human to get advice?

If the Fashion Assistant is not human, then how does the Assistant make an assessment?
The assistant relies on your questions as well as OpenAI’s special abilities to find appropriate answers, to produce suitable recommendations for your needs.

How do you ensure that answers are fair and correct?
The fashion assistant responds to the concrete content of your request and makes the assessment on that basis and Zalando’s openly and neutrally worded instructions to OpenAI. But please keep in mind that machine learning based answers can always be subjective, even wrong sometimes and may include some biases.If you would like to learn more about the embedded OpenAI model, please have a look at the policies of OpenAI which are available on https://openai.com/policies.

How can I get back to my last chat?
You can get back to your previous chat by clicking on the assistant icon on the same device. However, it will only be available for 20 minutes after you wrote your last chat message.

Will my chat data be shared with someone outside of Zalando?
The Fashion Assistant utilises the information you provide within the chat and shares it with OpenAI in order to generate the most suitable answers to your questions. However, OpenAI will not have access to your Zalando customer account data and will not use your chat to train their model.
